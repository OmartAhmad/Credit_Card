# Credit Card Project

This project is a front-end animation that demostates my knowledge of css selectors and general styling of vanilla css. It includes an HTML file for the structure, a CSS file for styling, and an `images` directory for storing related images.

## Features

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Organized project structure for easy navigation and maintenance.

## Usage

After opening the project directory, you can use the web interface to manage credit card information. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start interacting with the application.
